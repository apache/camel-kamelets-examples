# Apache Camel Kamelets Examples

[Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/) is a powerful open source integration framework based on known
Enterprise Integration Patterns with powerful bean integration.

### Introduction

This project provides various small prototypes for Apache Camel for low-code integration using JBang and Kamelets.

We suggest to look at [Camel JBang Examples](https://github.com/apache/camel-jbang-examples) first as these
examples are aimed to be better documented and generally better quality.

This repo is a place for experiments, prototypes and ad-hoc tasks.
