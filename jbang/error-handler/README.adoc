== Error Handler

This example shows in YAML DSL how to use route configuration to setup error handling.

=== Install JBang

First install JBang according to https://www.jbang.dev

When JBang is installed then you should be able to run from a shell:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang --version
----

This will output the version of JBang.

To run this example you can either install Camel on JBang via:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

Which allows to run CamelJBang with `camel` as shown below.

=== How to run

Then you can run this example using:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run *
----

=== Run directly from GitHub

The example can also be run directly by referring to the GitHub URL as shown:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/error-handler
----
