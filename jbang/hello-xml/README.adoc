== Hello Java

This example is a hello world example to run a XML route with Camel JBang.

=== Install JBang

First install JBang according to https://www.jbang.dev

When JBang is installed then you should be able to run from a shell:

This will output the version of JBang.

To run this example you can either install Camel on JBang via:

Which allows to run CamelJBang with `camel` as shown below.

=== How to run

Then you can run this example using:

[source,sh]

=== Live reload

You can run the example in dev mode which allows you to edit the example,
and hot-reload when the file is saved.

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run hi.xml --dev
----

=== Run directly from GitHub

The example can also be run directly by referring to the GitHub URL as shown:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel runhttps://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/hello-xml
----
