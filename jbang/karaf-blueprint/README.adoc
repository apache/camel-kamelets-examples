== Karaf Blueprint

This example shows the migration of a legacy OSGi blueprint example:
- https://github.com/apache/camel-karaf-examples/tree/main/examples/camel-example-mybatis/ 

Where the example source code has been copied to a flat structure, but otherwise unchanged.

=== Install JBang

First install JBang according to https://www.jbang.dev

When JBang is installed then you should be able to run from a shell:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang --version
----

This will output the version of JBang.

To run this example you can either install Camel on JBang via:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

Which allows to run CamelJBang with `camel` as shown below.

=== How to run

Then you can run this example using:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run *
----
