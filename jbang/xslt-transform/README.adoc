== XSLT Transformation

This example shows a basic XML transformation using XSLT style sheet.

=== Install JBang

First install JBang according to https://www.jbang.dev

When JBang is installed then you should be able to run from a shell:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang --version
----

This will output the version of JBang.

To run this example you can either install Camel on JBang via:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

Which allows to run CamelJBang with `camel` as shown below.

=== How to run

Then you can run this example using:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run *
----

=== Live updates of message transformation

You can do live changes to the stylesheet and see the output in real-time with Camel JBang by running:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel transform message --body=file:sample.xml --component=xslt --template=file:mystyle.xsl --pretty --watch
----

You can then edit the `mystyle.xsl` file, and save the file, and watch the terminal for updated result.
