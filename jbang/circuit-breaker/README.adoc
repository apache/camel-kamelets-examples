== Circuit Breaker

This example shows how Camel JBang can use ciruit breaker EIP.

=== Install JBang

First install JBang according to https://www.jbang.dev

When JBang is installed then you should be able to run from a shell:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang --version
----

This will output the version of JBang.

To run this example you can either install Camel on JBang via:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

Which allows to run CamelJBang with `camel` as shown below.

=== How to run

Then you can run this example using:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run *
----

Or run with JBang using the longer command line (without installing camel as app in JBang):

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang camel@apache/camel run *
----

While the Camel integration is running, then from another terminal type:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel get circuit-breaker
----

Which then output the state of the circuit breaker. You can run this command with `--watch` and see
how the state of the circuit breaker changes from closed to open due to many failures.

[source,sh]
----
$ camel get circuit-breaker --watch
----
