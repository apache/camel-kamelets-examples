== AWS Secrets Manager Vault Example

In this sample you'll use the AWS Secrets Manager Vault Properties Source

=== Install JBang

First install JBang according to https://www.jbang.dev

When JBang is installed then you should be able to run from a shell:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang --version
----

This will output the version of JBang.

To run this example you can either install Camel on JBang via:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

Which allows to run CamelJBang with `camel` as shown below.

=== Setup the AWS Secret Manager service

Create a secret on AWS

[source,sh]
----
aws secretsmanager create-secret --name SecretTest --description "Create a secret" --region eu-west-1 --secret-string secret 
----

=== Setting up the AWS credentials

This example uses the ProfileCredentialsProvider from AWS SDK v2. So you'll need to have a configuration file, locally to your machine.

In particular you'll need to have a file placed in `~/.aws/credentials`

with a content like the following

[source,sh]
----
[default]
aws_access_key_id = accessKey
aws_secret_access_key = secretKey
----

=== How to run

Then you can run this example using:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run timer-aws-secret-reloading.yaml
----

Or run it even shorter:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run *
----

Or run with JBang using the longer command line (without installing camel as app in JBang):

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang camel@apache/camel run timer-aws-secret-reloading.yaml
----



=== Modify the secret

You can list the secrets in use from the AWS security vault:

[source,sh]
----
camel get vault
----

While the integration is running you could modify the secret and the integration will reload automatically

[source,sh]
----
aws secretsmanager put-secret-value --secret-id SecretTest --region eu-west-1 --secret-string secretImproved
----

Now, get back, to the running Camel application and wait for the reloading.

And the secret should also now be listed as updated form the get vault command:

[source,sh]
----
camel get vault
----

=== Developer Web Console

You can enable the developer console via `--console` flag as show:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run timer-aws-secret-reloading.yaml --console
----

Then you can browse: http://localhost:8080/q/dev to introspect the running Camel applicaton.
