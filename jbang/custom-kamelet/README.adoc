== Custom Kamelet

This example is using a custom Kamelet that fetches random user data.

The custom kamelets can be located locally or shared on github.
This example demonstrates how to run this in both situations.


=== Install JBang

First install JBang according to https://www.jbang.dev

When JBang is installed then you should be able to run from a shell:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang --version
----

This will output the version of JBang.

To run this example you can either install Camel on JBang via:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

Which allows to run CamelJBang with `camel` as shown below.

=== How to run

Then you can run this example using:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run user.java --local-kamelet-dir=../../custom-kamelets
----

And to refer to the custom kamelets with link to github:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run user.java --local-kamelet-dir=https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/custom-kamelets
----


=== Run directly from GitHub

The example can also be run directly by referring to the GitHub URL as shown:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/custom-kamelet --local-kamelet-dir=https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/custom-kamelets
----
