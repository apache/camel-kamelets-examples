== JSon Transformation

This example shows a basic JSon transformation using simple and JQ languages.

=== Install JBang

First install JBang according to https://www.jbang.dev

When JBang is installed then you should be able to run from a shell:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang --version
----

This will output the version of JBang.

To run this example you can either install Camel on JBang via:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

Which allows to run CamelJBang with `camel` as shown below.

=== How to run

Then you can run this example using:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run beer-jq.yaml
----

Or run with JBang using the longer command line (without installing camel as app in JBang):

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang camel@apache/camel run beer-jq.yaml
----
