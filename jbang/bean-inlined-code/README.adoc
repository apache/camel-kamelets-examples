== YAML with inlined Java code

An example, of using YAML DSL with inlined Java code creating and configuring a bean,
to be used in the Camel route.

This shows the full flexibility by allowing to write a little bit of Java code
directly inlined in YAML DSL to make it possible to create and configure the bean
anyay you need, with the power of low-code prgramming.


=== Install JBang

First install JBang according to https://www.jbang.dev

When JBang is installed then you should be able to run from a shell:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang --version
----

This will output the version of JBang.

To run this example you can either install Camel on JBang via:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

Which allows to run CamelJBang with `camel` as shown below.

=== How to run

Then you can run this example using:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run *
----

Or run with JBang using the longer command line (without installing camel as app in JBang):

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang camel@apache/camel run *
----


=== Live reload

You can run the example in dev mode which allows you to edit the example,
and hot-reload when the file is saved.

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run * --dev
----
