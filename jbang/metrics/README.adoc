== Metrics

This example shows using Micrometer metrics with Camel JBang.

=== Install JBang

First install JBang according to https://www.jbang.dev

When JBang is installed then you should be able to run from a shell:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang --version
----

This will output the version of JBang.

To run this example you can either install Camel on JBang via:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

Which allows to run CamelJBang with `camel` as shown below.

=== How to run

Then you can run this example using:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run metrics.camel.yaml
----

=== Run directly from github

The example can also be run directly by referring to the github URL as shown:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel runhttps://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/metrics
----

=== Developer Web Console

You can enable the developer console via `--console` flag as show:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run metrics.yaml --console
----

Then you can browse: http://localhost:8080/q/dev to introspect the running Camel application,
such as browsing the micrometer, where you can see the captured statistics.

The web console outputs data in text/html by default when using a web browser.
However you can obtain the data in JSon format such as the micrometer with the following curl command:

[source,bash]
----
curl -s -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/q/dev/micrometer
----

And if you have `jq` installed to nicely format and output JSon in color then run:

[source,bash]
----
curl -s -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/q/dev/micrometer | jq
----

The metrics can also be displayed from the shell via:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel get metric
----
